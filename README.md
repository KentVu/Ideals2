<!-- Plugin description -->
This plugin is experimental rewrite of SuduIDE/ideals (which in turn also pretty experimental), converted into Kotlin. ideals is a project that supports listening to LSP requests and translate to IntelliJ platform's API.

I've also enabled it to run with Android Studio, by making it run manually from a tool window and currently only support one project (the currently opening) at a time.

(I could not run ideals in Android Studio since it always freeze at update indexes stage when project was opened programmatically)

I also have no intention to publish it to the marketplace!! This is the place where I experience with the platform and hopefully help maximize my work-from-everywhere philosophy :p
